To run successfully in dev mode follow the next steps:

________________________________________________________
1. In the terminal go to the /backend folder and run :
### `npm install`  (that will install all backend dependencies)
### `npm run dev`  (that will start the server in port 8000)
Open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) to view the server running in the browser.



2. Then in the terminal go to the /frontend folder and run :
### `npm install`  (that will install all frontend dependencies)
### `npm start`  (that will start the client app in port 3000) (for better experience use Chrome)
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
Note: Keep this port available for this app because the backend only accepts calls from http://localhost:3000
if see Not Authorized page in client go to /backend/src/config/cors.config.ts and modify the origin: ["http://localhost:3000"] 
with the assigned port for your client app.

Now you can enjoy the Pokemon app ü•≥Ô∏èü•≥Ô∏èü•≥Ô∏è
